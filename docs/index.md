# Bringing AI and Software together

### Cut through the buzzwords

Every day we see more and more of the same hype and churn in the tech world. There is a lot going on and it can be even more to handle. I
remove complicated jargon and bring companies solutions that work for them and their comfortability between the black box of AI and the thousands of lines 
of custom coded solutions.

## About me

My name is Alan Wade and I am a freelance software engineer, dedicated to providing tailored solutions that align with my clients' long-term needs. My goal is to build scalable, sustainable systems that deliver lasting value.

With seven years of experience in transportation and logistics, I have learned the critical importance of designing systems that can scale efficiently. Effective system development requires deep knowledge of diverse tools, each chosen to fit the specific job at hand.
My expertise spans various domains, from setting up Kubernetes servers to analyzing large datasets using cloud solutions like Google BigQuery. I have also worked extensively with Apache Kafka connectors to integrate new data streams seamlessly.

I believe technology is a powerful enabler, helping people optimize their efficiency and focus on what truly matters. By building intelligent, data-driven solutions, I aim to reduce noise and provide actionable insights that empower individuals and businesses to make informed decisions and drive meaningful progress.
